# ETDRK4RDP-Scheme-Serial
The are two sets of ETDRK4RDP codes implemented in Matlab and Fortran in this file. The four set of Matlab codes in Matlab_Codes file are implemented to specifically solve RDEs using Exponential time differencing schemes using real and distinct poles rational approximations (ETDRK4RDP) scheme. Extensions of the Matlab codes to Fortran (Fortran_codes) for ETDRK4P04 and ETDRK4P22 are also attached for parallel implementation for all the test problems. Users may need to install UMFPACK and Suites Sparse from https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse/releases and https://geo.mff.cuni.cz/~lh/Fortran/UMFPACK/ respectively to get the program to execute in Fortran. Details of the problems and results can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01245. Each file has a "read me" that indicates how to run the codes in Matlab and Fortran.
