# ETDRK4RDP-Scheme-Serial
The four set of Matlab codes are implemented to specifically solve RDEs using Exponential time differencing schemes using real and distinct poles rational approximations (ETDRK4RDP) scheme. Details of the problems and results can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01245. Each file has a "read me" file that indicates how to run the codes in Matlab.
