# ETDRK4RDP-Scheme-Serial
The four set of Matlab codes are implemented to specifically solve RDEs using Exponential time differencing schemes using real and distinct poles rational approximations (ETDRK4RDP) scheme. Extensions of the Matlab code to Fortran are also attached for parallel implementation. Users may need to install UMFPACK and Suites Sparse from https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse/releases and https://geo.mff.cuni.cz/~lh/Fortran/UMFPACK/ respectively to get the program to execute in Fortran. Details of the problems and results can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01245. Each file has a "read me" that indicates how to run the codes in Matlab and Fortran.
